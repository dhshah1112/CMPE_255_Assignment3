# CMPE_255_Assignment3

The aim for this assignment was to do principled step by step and phase by phase data science with the three methodologies i.e. KDD, SEMMA and CRISP DM.

We needed to demonstrate a project which used all stages of the the methodology. It was mentioned in the assignment that we can use detailed help from chatgpt/gpt4 for making sure each and every stage and all the subtasks were fully complete and in depth and in detailed. I have verified the chatgpt code manually and all the steps were included in the code. Every methodology required a different dataset, so I used 3 differenrt dataset.

The assignemnt asked us to document all methodologies into a medium article, one medium article for each of the methodology.
Link for medium articles are as follows:
SEMMA:    https://medium.com/@dhshah1112/deciphering-diabetes-data-a-comprehensive-journey-through-semma-methodology-4e8d6756171c
KDD:      https://medium.com/@dhshah1112/navigating-londons-property-market-a-detailed-exploration-through-kdd-methodology-hh-61eb9c4585df
CRISP DM: https://medium.com/@dhshah1112/unearthing-cricketing-gems-a-deep-dive-into-ipl-player-performances-through-crisp-dm-methodology-7211721656e0

Further, for documentation I created reseach papers for all the methodologies. I was encountering some issues while submitting it via arxiv so I uploaded it in this repo itself.
